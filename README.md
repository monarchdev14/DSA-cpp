# DSA-cpp
my journey of completing considerable problems in DSA with cpp
# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my systematic learning and implementation of **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **C++**.  
The goal of this repository is to build strong problem-solving skills, understand core algorithmic patterns, and prepare for technical interviews.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice DSA concepts in a structured manner
- Strengthen fundamentals (logic, recursion, optimization)
- Track learning progress
- Prepare for coding interviews (FAANG / Product-based companies)

---

## 🛠️ Language Used

- **C++**
- Standard Template Library (STL)

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

- Concept first, code later
- Focus on understanding patterns instead of memorizing solutions
- Practice problems topic-wise
- Revisit difficult problems multiple times

---

## 📌 Platforms Used for Practice

- GeeksforGeeks
- LeetCode
- Udemy (DSA Course)

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. Navigate to the topic folder
2. Read the problem statement (if provided)
3. Go through the implementation
4. Try solving the problem yourself before checking the solution

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

- Problems are added as I learn new topics
- Code quality and optimization improve over time
- Repository will be updated regularly

---

## 📄 Disclaimer

This repository is for **learning and practice purposes only**.  
Some problems may have multiple valid solutions.
